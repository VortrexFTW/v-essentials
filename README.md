# Vortrex's Essential Resources (v-essentials)
For GTA Connected and Mafia Connected
Publicly available for anybody to use. I hope you find some of these useful.

## Resources
### v-admin
Server management and moderation. People added as admin can kick, ban, etc. Bans are saved with IP, reason, admin, and timestamp.
Also has ability to block game trainers (GTA IV only) and built-in SCM/SCO game scripts (some trainers and mods use these and blocking them will prevent them being used on your server.)
Any player who joins with an admin's name but wrong IP will be automatically kicked.

### v-afk
AFK detection using game focus/defocus (alt+tab). If `v-scoreboard` is loaded, it'll show "PAUSED" next to AFK players in the list. If `v-nametags` is loaded, the nametag will show a red "PAUSED" above AFK players heads.

### v-chat
Enhanced chat features. Provides scrollable chat history, automatic translation, and converts emoji names or symbols (e.g. `:thumbsup:` or `:)`) to the actual emoji. If the `v-playercolours` resource is loaded, names in chat will show the player's colour, otherwise the names will be white.

### v-deathmessages
Shows messages when a player dies, with killer name.

### v-extracontent
Makes it easy to add and use custom content on your server. Images audio files, fonts, DFF models, TXD textures, COL collisions, excluded snow models, removed building/world models, rendering images in the 3D game world, spawning server objects (both grouped and ungrouped) and moving gates/doors.

### v-fixes
Adds custom scripting events and workarounds for things that GTAC doesn't have built-in. The events can be used in any other resource with any language [exactly like the built-in events](https://wiki.gtaconnected.com/HowTo/Events). Some events that pertain to an element (ped, vehicle, etc) are bindable to that element to be used with bindEventHandler, but this is optional. You can use addEventHandler too. Also adds syncing some element properties that GTAC doesn't sync by default. See the resource's README for more info.

### v-help
Shows commands and info for all the resources here that the server is running. Detects which resources are running and only shows commands for those.

### v-hudtoggle
Two simple keybinds to toggle HUD and chat on and off. Good for screenshots and stuff.
F7 to toggle HUD and F8 for chatbox.

### v-interiors
Currently only for Vice City. Enables interiors. Just walk up to the door to enter/exit.

### v-joinquit
Announces to all players when somebody joins or leaves the server.

### v-logo
Shows an image in the bottom right corner (default is GTAC/MafiaC logo)

### v-lookat
Only works on GTA SA. Makes player heads turn to face where they are looking. Also syncs to other players

### v-mexui-designer
Simple GUI designer for MexUI. Not finished yet.

### v-nametags
Custom nametags. GTA Connected has built-in nametags but they're ugly. Mafia Connected doesn't provide nametags built-in.

### v-passenger
Adds pressing the "G" key to enter as passenger. GTA Connected only.

### v-playerblips
Adds blips that show where players are.

### v-playercolours
Assigns a random colour to each player. This will also show player colours on other resources that use it (`v-chat`, `v-nametags`, `v-scoreboard`, etc)

### v-runcode
**Caution** - Adds commands to run code, available on both server and client. Allowing players to run server-side code in-game may pose a security risk. I don't recommend leaving it running all the time, only when you need to use it.

### v-scoreboard
Adds a scoreboard/player-list, shown when holding the TAB key

### v-servernames
Changes the server name every X milliseconds (set in `config.json`), changing a random slogan/text on the end of your server name

### v-snow
Starts the server with specified snowing states, configured with cvars "fallingsnow" and "groundsnow" in `server.xml`

### v-spawn
Spawns your player. Custom spawn points can be added by server admins using /addspawn.

### v-time
Starts the server with a specified hour and minute, configured with cvars "hour" and "minute" in `server.xml`

### v-translate
Obsolete. Only included for legacy purposes and archive. The translation functionality has been added to `v-chat`

### v-weather
Starts the server with a specified weather, configured with "weather" in `server.xml`
